    A quadtree is a sorting tool for two-dimensional space, most
    commonly used to reduce the number of required collision 
    calculations in a two-dimensional scene. In this context, 
    the scene is stepped without collision detection, then a 
    quadtree is constructed from all of the boundaries
    
    .. caution::
        
        Just because a quad tree has split does not mean entities will be empty. Any
        entities which overlay any of the lines of the split will be included in the 
        parent of the quadtree.
    
    .. tip::
        
        It is important to tweak bucket size and depth to the problem, but a common error 
        is too small a bucket size. It is typically not reasonable to have a bucket size 
        smaller than 16; A good starting point is 64, then modify as appropriate. Larger
        buckets reduce the overhead of the quad tree which could easily exceed the improvement
        from reduced collision checks. The max depth is typically just a sanity check since 
        depth greater than 4 or 5 would either indicate a badly performing quadtree (too 
        dense objects, use an r-tree or kd-tree) or a very large world (where an iterative
